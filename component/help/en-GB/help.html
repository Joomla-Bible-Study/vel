	<title>Joomla Vulnerable Extensions List Notice Help</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>You will notice your system might take a minute or more to process the list. Be patient, it is a long list</p>
<p>If extensions appear on this list, a match has been made between your installed extensions and those that appear on the Joomla Vulnerable Extensions List. This doesn't mean you are necessarily at risk. <strong>The matching to extensions is not perfect. It is a name match only. </strong> So, for instance, Atomic Gallery might be on the VEL list, but you have Atomic template on your system. In the name field, Atomic is found both on the list and in your installed extensions so VEL Notice counts that as a match. Once the VEL List become more sophisticated, the match will become more accurate.</p>
<p> We attempt to match your installed version with the problem version reported on the list. If that match occurs you will see a RED warning.</p>
<p> If an installed extensions matches the list but we cannot match the version then a YELLOW warning appears.</p> 
<p>If you see a GREEN indicator it means we have matched your version to the reported fixed version. This will be part of a future release of VEL Notice. </p>
<p>Always check the list for yourself to verify. </p>
